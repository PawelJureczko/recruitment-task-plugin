# recruitment-task-plugin

To run this script all you need is to go to your wordpress instance, wp-content -> plugins then create folder with name "pawel-jureczko-recruitment-task-plugin" (it's crucial to not make any typo here). When you make it, go to your admin dashboard -> plugins -> Installed Plugins, find Pawel Jureczko Recruitment Task Plugin, and activate it.
When you want to put this in your page, you just need to use shortcode [pj-todolist-plugin] and here there you go!
